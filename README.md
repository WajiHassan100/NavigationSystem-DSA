# My Navigation System – Path Finder 🚗🗺️

This is a C++ project implementing an advanced city navigation system using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## ✨ Features

- **Graph-based city mapping** using adjacency lists
- **Shortest path finding** using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- **Minimum spanning tree** generation using Prim’s algorithm
- Road blocking/unblocking & maintenance modes
- Fuel cost and efficiency estimations
- Budget-based route suggestions
- Sorting cities by estimated fuel requirement
- Admin and user modes

## 💡 Functionalities

- Suggest cities reachable within a certain budget
- Find farthest reachable cities
- Show cities sorted by fuel requirement
- Calculate shortest route and estimate fuel cost
- Build and edit city maps dynamically

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **C++**
- **DSA (Graphs, Priority Queues)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Compile the `NavigationSystem.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ NavigationSystem.cpp -o NavigationSystem`).
2. Make sure `defaultMap.txt` file is present for loading cities and roads.
3. Run: `./NavigationSystem`
4. Follow console prompts.
